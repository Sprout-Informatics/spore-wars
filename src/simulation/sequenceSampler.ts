/**
 * Sequence Sampling Module
 *
 * When a student "takes a sample" from the patient, this module:
 * 1. Looks at the current gut microbiome state (abundances of all species)
 * 2. Probabilistically selects a bacterium proportional to its abundance
 * 3. Extracts a random ~500 bp subsequence from that bacterium's 16S rRNA gene
 * 4. Returns a FASTA-formatted sequence that students can BLAST at NCBI
 *
 * Students then classify the sequence as:
 * - Host commensal bacteria (healthy microbiome species)
 * - SER-109 / Vowst therapeutic bacteria (Firmicutes spore-formers)
 * - Clostridioides difficile (the pathogen)
